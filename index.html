                        A study in 2014 published by The Economic Times
                        said that undivided Andhra Pradesh had emerged as
                        the "most-preferred" tourist destination for domestic
                        travellers with about 20 per cent share in the total
                        domestic tourist visits across India in 2012.
                        Andhra Pradesh is the home of many religious pilgrim centres:
                        Tirumala Tirupati, the abode of Lord Venkateswara, is
                        the second richest and most visited religious centre (of any faith)
                        in the world.

                            This temple is also one among the 108divyadesam
                            dedicated to Lord Vishnu. Brahmotsavams will be held every year
                            and as many as 5,00,000 devotees will throng to the hill for
                            seeking blessings of the lord.Kanaka Durga Temple of goddess

                            Vijayawada on the banks of Krishna River. A large number
                            of pilgrims attend the colourful celebrations of Tepotsavam

                        The Eiffel Tower from the Place du Trocadéro
                        The Eiffel Tower is acknowledged as the universal symbol
                        of Paris and France. It was originally designed by Émile
                        Nouguier and Maurice Koechlin. In March 1885 Gustave Eiffel,
                        known primarily as a successful iron engineer, submitted a
                        plan for a tower to the French Ministre du Commerce et de
                        l'Industrie.[4] He entered a competition for students studying
                        at the university. The winning proposal would stand as the
                        centerpiece of the 1889 Exposition. Eiffel's was one of over
                        100 submissions. Eiffel's proposal was finally chosen in June
                        1886. Even before its construction, the Tower's uniqueness
                        was noticed. The Eiffel Tower was finally inaugurated on
                        March 31, 1889.[4] Currently about 6.9 million people visit
                        the Eiffel tower each year.[5]
